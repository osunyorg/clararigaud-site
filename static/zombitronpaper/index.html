<div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
<p>This article explores the possibilities of reusing obsolete
smartphones and tablets to build new interactive systems. Taking the
case of a musical instrument, I present my research into the design of a
controller made from various of these obsolete smartphones. From the
diagnostic stage to the creation of a new autonomous electronic object,
I document the process, the barriers and the levers encountered. Based
on these explorations and discussions with two professional musicians, I
provide several insights into the software and hardware aspects, with a
view to continuing this work, towards the creation of an open-source
toolkit enabling anyone to build new interactive systems with old
devices. I discuss the implication of how a high-level web-based
approach could allow designers to enter the black box and foster
permacomputing using smartphones.</p>
</div>
</header>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As electronic devices become increasingly widespread across the
globe, mountains of electronic waste are reaching new heights. A recent
report of the Global E-waste Monitor <span class="citation"
data-cites="balde_global_2024"></span> estimates that 62 billion kg of
electronic waste has been generated worldwide in 2022. Of this 62
billion, only 22% is documented as being recycled in a controlled and
environmentally-friendly way and 22% is stored as waste in open dumps.
The remaining 56% is recycled in uncontrolled circuits, which may
release materials such as mercury or plastic into the environment
exposing people to unhealthy work and unsanitary conditions <span
class="citation" data-cites="rifat_breaking_2019"></span>.</p>
<p>Smartphones and other communication devices account for 8% of this
waste. They are often abandoned because the battery no longer works, the
screen is broken, they do not have enough memory space, the software is
obsolete or they are replaced with more recent technology <span
class="citation"
data-cites="prabhu_n_disposal_2023 mosesso_obsolescence_2023"></span>.
Most of the time, these devices are kept by their owners and are not
recycled, repaired or reused <span class="citation"
data-cites="prabhu_n_disposal_2023"></span>. This means that there are
plenty of phones lying dormant in the drawers of millions of people
<span class="citation"
data-cites="ademe_longue_2023 wilson_hibernating_2017"></span>.</p>
<p>Of course, work is being done on how to reduce this waste generated
by smartphones. In particular, the main approach is to extend their
lifespan, which is not always easy, given that many manufacturers make
their equipment obsolete, and even base their business models on this
obsolescence. More recently, legislative constraints have been
implemented, and initiatives such as the reparability index or
durability index have appeared in France <span class="citation"
data-cites="ademe_preparatory_2021 noauthor_decret_2024 noauthor_decret_2020"></span>
to limit this obsolescence, but this only applies to the most recently
built devices, leaving a whole range of these smartphones out of use.
Another way of extending the life of smartphones is to refurbish them
and buy them second-hand when the owner wants to get rid of them, but
this only concerns the most recent models as well, leaving obsolete
models aside.</p>
<p>The case I am interested in is the one where technologies are still
functional but have been rendered obsolete anyway because they cannot
keep up with current usage. For example, because they only have 3G,
they’re no longer powerful enough to support the latest software
updates, or their storage memory is saturated <span class="citation"
data-cites="mosesso_obsolescence_2023 magnier_replaced_2022"></span>.
Although there are ways of prolonging the use of one’s smartphone,
prolonging the life of an obsolete device requires compromises in terms
of use or advanced technical knowledge.</p>
<p>In this article, I propose a new approach consisting of combining
several obsolete smartphones with each other to enable the creation of a
new interactive system. I explore the possibilities that old devices can
offer with an approach as high-level as possible, that does not involve
reinstalling a custom OS, and that does not require a high degree of
coding knowledge. After a brief overview of the existing works, I
present the <span class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> project,
which consists of setting up a toolbox of design and open-source
software, and detail my explorations in the construction of this
toolbox. Then, on the basis of these initial explorations, I document my
research into the design of a new interactive system from the very first
stage of getting it up and running. Using 14 discarded smartphones, I
detail step-by-step the operations and problems encountered, and how
these can be work-around, depending on the version of the operating
system (OS), their performance and their general state of repair. Then,
I present the discussions I had with two professional musicians on how
this tool could be integrated into their work and practice, giving
promising leads as to the appropriation of this approach. Finally, I
explore the possible directions this work could take, in particular in
the context of musical interfaces, to enable rapid prototyping, or as a
pedagogical tool.</p>
<h1 id="background-and-related-work">Background and related work</h1>
<p>Smartphones and other communication devices account for 8% of the
total of E-waste generated worldwide <span class="citation"
data-cites="balde_global_2024"></span>. Obsolescence is the main reason
why connected devices end-up being discarded, often because of
limitations in terms of storage memory, computing capacity or
communication protocols, which no longer allow the device to function in
a wider technical ecosystem <span class="citation"
data-cites="boano_enabling_2021"></span>.</p>
<p>In addition to obsolescence, smartphones and tablets, compared to
other communication devices, are also affected by a phenomenon of
frequent renewal linked to the evolution of the perception of the value
of their device by their owner <span class="citation"
data-cites="magnier_replaced_2022"></span>. The average length of use of
smartphones by their first owner is estimated at 3.5 years in Western
Europe <span class="citation"
data-cites="magnier_replaced_2022"></span>. Smartphone obsolescence is
particularly linked to rapidly evolving technology and therefore to
software that becomes more demanding in terms of resources and is only
maintained a few years after its release. For example, in the case of
Apple products, the latest OS version supported at the time of writing
is IOS 18 <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and the last device to be able to
install version 17 is the iPhone XS<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> released in 2018. This
means that all Apple smartphones released before 2018 can no longer get
updates (including security updates). Android devices suffer from the
same problem, with the difference that it is possible to install more
recent versions of Android on older devices, which are more resources
demanding and may not be suited to the configuration of an older phone.
Generally speaking, the applications that are loaded onto smartphones
and tablets are becoming more and more memory- and compute-intensive,
slowing down devices and limiting their overall usability <span
class="citation" data-cites="mosesso_obsolescence_2023"></span>.</p>
<p>The main problem with smartphones renewal, is knowing what to do with
them once they are no longer in use. The first approach is to
reintegrate them into recovery circuits, either by recycling them, which
recovers the rare metals that make up these devices (and therefore
reduces the devastating extraction of these components), or by extending
their life through refurbishing services or reuse strategies <span
class="citation" data-cites="prabhu_n_disposal_2023"></span>.
Refurbishing smartphones is a quite popular strategy since it has
advantages for both manufacturers and consumers, but it is only reserved
for the most recent products, and does not guarantee the lifespan or
reliability of the refurbished device <span class="citation"
data-cites="hazelwood_life_2021"></span>. Furthermore, the recycling and
reuse circuits are not always beneficial from an environmental and
health point of view due to the infrastructures and standards in
different parts of the world <span class="citation"
data-cites="balde_global_2024"></span> and the rebound effects linked to
energy expenditure and greenhouse gas emissions <span class="citation"
data-cites="zink_comparative_2014 makov_does_2018"></span>. In addition,
many of these devices are not integrated into the recycling or
refurbishing circuits at all. Wilson et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="wilson_hibernating_2017"></span> found in their 2017 study
that over 50% of participants keep at least one mobile phone at home
that they have replaced, usually “as a spare”. In France, ADEME <span
class="citation" data-cites="ademe_longue_2023"></span> estimates that 1
million smartphones are lying dormant in French people’s drawers.</p>
<p>Studies have explored how to extend the life of obsolete devices,
through alternatives and strategies for continuing to use them as their
main smartphones. For example, Mosesso et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="mosesso_obsolescence_2023"></span> have studied the
different reasons and strategies used by people who continue to use
their obsolete smartphones. Goodwin et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="goodwin_quantifying_2023"></span> explored the availability
of applications on obsolete Apple devices. These two studies conclude
that it is possible to find ways of continuing to use ageing
smartphones, but that these strategies often require compromises or
extra effort that not all users are prepared to commit to. Some of these
techniques may as well involve extra skills, for example to install new
alternative OSes<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> on Android smartphones.</p>
<p>Another approach to reuse is to repurpose obsolete smartphones <span
class="citation"
data-cites="hansson_decade_2021 zink_comparative_2014 blevis_sustainable_2007"></span>
so that they can be specialised to a precise task, better suited to
their performance. For example Switzer et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="switzer_junkyard_2023"></span> explored techniques to
repurpose smartphones into specialised servers for cloud computing.
Klugman et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="klugman_android_2018"></span> and Norbisrath et al.<span
class="citation" data-cites="norbisrath_empowering_2025"></span>
explored how to turn them into gateways for IOT. Smartphones and tablets
can also be repurposed to be dedicated to a particular application
downloaded into it, for example in educational contexts <span
class="citation" data-cites="li_smartphone_2010"></span>. The main
obstacles in this repurposing lie in the heterogeneity of devices <span
class="citation" data-cites="li_smartphone_2010"></span> and the
relatively expert operations involved, if this repurposing goes beyond
simply downloading a dedicated application. In addition, Apple
smartphones are poorly represented in smartphone repurposing projects as
they do not allow the installation of third party applications.</p>
<p>Repurposing techniques are popular in the Do It Yourself and hacking
communities <span class="citation"
data-cites="wakkary_sustainable_2013 lu_unmaking_2024"></span>, and are
attracting widespread interest from researchers in sustainable human
computer interaction <span class="citation"
data-cites="jackson_breakdown_2014"></span>. In particular, the
burgeoning permacomputing <span class="citation"
data-cites="mansoux_permacomputing_2023"></span> movement is interested
in what can be done with what exists in terms of technological hardware,
and in particular in creation. This movement brings together not so
recent approaches of creation but which, now, in the current context,
are tinged with a particular urgency. Reuse in design has been a
particular focus of Nicolas Nova <span class="citation"
data-cites="nova_du_2020"></span>, who presents the reuse of old
technologies as a low-tech approach to design. Some new media artists
are incorporating the reuse of dysfunctional and obsolete objects into
their artistic practice, in line with the Zombie-media concept <span
class="citation" data-cites="hertz_zombie_2012"></span>. This is the
case, for example, of Recyclism<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, who have been exploring
the revival of obsolete technologies for many years now. Others use
electronic waste in their work to send out a message about technological
consumption <span class="citation"
data-cites="argabrite_technology_2022"></span>. The permacomputing
approach is also closely linked to that of demoscene, which since the
80s has been exploring the most restrictive ways of creating animations
or music on the few remaining bits available on the first game consoles,
and still today continues to gather around “release parties” where
everyone comes to take part in demo<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> competitions in their
own category (weight/platform).</p>
<p>While these DIY communities are reputed for their openness and habit
of sharing knowledge and technique <span class="citation"
data-cites="wakkary_sustainable_2013 rigaud_ressources_2023"></span>,
the fact remains that these practices are reserved for relatively expert
users. Electronic objects have become smaller and complex <span
class="citation" data-cites="girard_computing_2024"></span>, and the
smartphone has become a little box filled with different sensors that
are difficult to reuse and tamper with <span class="citation"
data-cites="nova_figures_2018"></span>. A few soldering points are no
longer enough to hack and bend must devices, leaving the reuse of
obsoletes smartphones relatively absent from these projects.</p>
<p>In response to the increasing complexity of electronic devices, which
makes certain sustainable practices difficult for the general public to
access, Roedl et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="roedl_sustainable_2015"></span> encourages HCI researchers
to develop tools to help with the appropriation of these practices and
techniques. Similarly, Lu et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="lu_unmaking_2024"></span> argues for a field of HCI research
focusing on the design of tools for recycling, recovery and reuse.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, there are initiatives and contexts in which the reuse
of obsolete smartphones can be explored. But the complexity of these
devices and their heterogeneity require advanced technical knowledge,
which can act as a barrier to their reuse. It is therefore crucial to
design tools to encourage and facilitate the appropriation of techniques
for repurposing these obsolete devices, and fully integrate obsolete
smartphones in the permacomputing garden.</p>
<h1 id="zombitron-project-and-principle">Zombitron project and
principle</h1>
<p>The aim of this article is to present the initial work on the design
of new interactive systems using a high-level approach through the <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> project. The aim of <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> is to enable new systems
to be designed from obsolete smartphones and tablets, taking into
account their heterogeneity. Given that these devices offer many
possibilities in terms of connectivity and interactivity, the objective
is to explore how we can continue to benefit from them. <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> aims to make the design of
new systems based on these devices accessible by facilitating access to
the functionalities of the black box that are smartphones and tablets,
and to become an open-source and collaborative tool enabling artists and
everyone to address these issues of obsolescence in the case of the
smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="principle">Principle</h2>
<figure id="fig:zombitronprinciple">
<img src="images/principle.jpg" />
<figcaption>The basic idea behind <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> is to connect several
smartphones together to share their information.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <span class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> principle is
based on the fact that whatever the release date of a smartphone and its
OS, it has a WiFi card and a browser. From there, it is possible to
connect these smartphones and tablets to a server that displays web
interfaces and exchanges information via the WiFi connection.</p>
<p>As shown (Figure <a href="#fig:zombitronprinciple"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:zombitronprinciple">1</a>), the system is composed
of different units that can be any connected device with a browser:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A unit that acts as a hotspot so that others can connect to it
locally.</p></li>
<li><p>A unit that runs a terminal enabling a <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> instance to be run and an
<code>http</code> server to be generated on this network, also enabling
the <code>websocket</code> protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>One or more units that will connect to the server as web
clients.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, depending on its configuration, a unit can act as a
hotspot (1), run the server (2) and display a web interface (3). It is
also possible to use a computer to run the server and an external router
to create a local network.</p>
<p>The way in which the system is implemented will essentially depend on
the capabilities of each of the units:</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-local-network">Creating a local network</h3>
<p>There are several ways of creating a local network. The simplest way
is to use a dedicated router, for example an internet box. But in the
case of an interface designed to be autonomous and operate without any
devices other than the smartphones and tablets it is made up of, a
shared connection needs to be set up. To do this, it is possible to
activate tethering mode on certain devices. This option is widely
available, but some OSes do not allow this option to be activated if
there is no access to mobile data. The unit bundle must therefore
include at least one device enabling tethering without mobile data.</p>
<h3 id="running-a-server-with-textitnode.js">Running a server with <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span></h3>
<p>To run a <span class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> server,
one of the units needs to be able to run a terminal. To do this, <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> uses the <span
class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span> application, which emulates a
Linux terminal on Android devices. This enables packages to be
downloaded using “apt” and <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> to be run. With <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span>, an <code>http</code> server
is set up to deliver webpages to other units connected to the network,
and a <code>websockets</code> server is used to send data between units
in real time.</p>
<h3 id="displaying-web-interfaces">Displaying web interfaces</h3>
<figure id="fig:principlewebpage">
<img src="images/webpages.png" />
<figcaption>This images shows how one can create a new interface by
loading webpages on different smartphones.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once this environment has been set up, it is possible to set up any
web application that is capable of being executed on the smartphone
browser. For example, figure <a href="#fig:principlewebpage"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:principlewebpage">2</a>
shows the control interfaces loaded on different smartphones composing
music. Each smartphone displays a webpage and can send messages related
to touch events to the other units.</p>
<h2 id="first-explorations">First explorations</h2>
<p>Based on this principle, two musical instrument prototypes have been
designed: <em>Zombitronica</em> and <em>Zombichord</em>. These two
prototypes are built using the <em>Tone.js</em> library dedicated to
sound synthesis through web audio <span class="citation"
data-cites="jensenius_2013_2017"></span>. From a hardware point of view,
both are built from reused materials, and operate in standalone
mode.</p>
<h3 id="zombitronica">Zombitronica</h3>
<figure id="fig:zombitronicacontrollers">
<img src="images/zombitronica.png" />
<figcaption>Zombitronica is the first prototype exploring the principle
of <span class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>, made with 4
discarded smartphones and a loud-speaker.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Zombitronica is the first prototype based on 4 smartphones and a
loudspeaker, all second-hand. The interface has been designed to explore
different types of touch controllers for generating music (Figure <a
href="#fig:zombitronicacontrollers" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:zombitronicacontrollers">3</a>). It is made up of a
sequencer for selecting the notes played by the 4 instruments over 8
beats, 4 sliders for controlling the volume of each of the instruments,
a two-dimensional slider for controlling a 5th instrument (its pitch and
volume) and 3 potentiometers controlling the speed of the metronome,
distortion and reverb. From a hardware point of view, all the phones are
powered by a usb hub, and the phone generating the music is connected to
the speaker via a 3,5mm jack. A laser-cut sheet of 3mm PMMA delimits the
screen areas corresponding to the control interfaces, and holds the 4
smartphones and the loudspeaker in place. Each component rests on a
plate suspended from the top by a system of screws, nuts and
spacers.</p>
<h3 id="zombichord">Zombichord</h3>
<p><em>Zombichord</em> is a second prototype inspired by the Omnichord<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and built using an Android 5 tablet
and an IOS smartphone. On this prototype, the <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> server is run on the tablet,
which also displays an interface for playing chords, and an iPhone 6
displaying an interface for playing notes on the scale corresponding to
that chord [figure <a href="#fig:zombichordinterface"

<figcaption><em>Zombichord</em> is a the second prototype exploring the
principle of <span class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>. It was
designed by Romain Segaud and Marion Jolas, inspired by the
Omnichord.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the hardware, a thick piece of wood was hollowed out with a wood
router to accommodate the two devices. Holes were drilled to allow the
lightning-type cable connected to the iPhone to pass through on one side
and a mini usb cable to supply power to the tablet on the other. The
lightning cable is used to output both the sound signal and to supply
power to the phone, so a few soldering points were used to make a small
assembly that simply reveals a female jack (for the sound output) and a
female coaxial socket for supplying 5V to the two devices.</p>
<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>
<p>These two prototypes enabled me to test a web approach to creating
two musical interfaces on discarded smartphones and tablets. Although
only the touch screen was used, they already enabled me to identify
certain opportunities and limitations linked to the age of these
devices, particularly in terms of performance and functionality. The
choice of implementing the software in webpage format on older
smartphones, which have less computing power than today’s products, may
mean that we have to use lightweight applications. Devices that only
load a touch interface and send their data via <code>websockets</code>
did not pose any problem, but the use of a library that requires a
little more CPU processing, such as <em>Tone.js</em> doing sound
synthesis, should be considered for rather more powerful smartphones. In
order to eliminate the latency of the two prototypes, the use of
<em>Tone.js</em> was restricted to the activation of pre-recorded
samples. This opens up opportunities to explore how the combination of
older and more efficient equipment can overcome these limitations. The
second prototype was designed using a tablet running Android 5.0. For
this tablet, the <span class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span>
application was no longer supported, which means that the package
database is no longer updated, limiting the version of <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> to version 12. A few
readjustments to the code enabled me to build the application with <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> 12 without any problems.</p>
<h1
id="studying-the-possibilities-offered-by-obsolete-smartphones">Studying
the possibilities offered by obsolete smartphones</h1>
<p>On the basis of the two explorations made through the
<em>Zombitronica</em> and <em>Zombichord</em> prototypes, I have sought
to confront this approach with a more general situation, to consider the
limits that a variety of these old devices may have, and the ways in
which they can be overcome. With a view to creating a common tool that
would enable everyone to design with obsolete devices, I looked at a
wider range of these devices to document, step by step, the specifics in
terms of installation and configuration that I may encounter. I
collected a set of 14 smartphones that had been given to me or that I
had bought cheaply second-hand. For each of the phones, I went through
the different stages to set up the basis of the <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> principle. This time, in
addition to the touch sensor, I integrated the Inertial Measurement
Units (IMU) sensors: gyroscope and accelerometer, common to most
smartphones since 2012.</p>
<p>During this exploration, I set up a common code base on a git
repository<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, allowing me to run tests on the
different devices, and which I improved as I went along so that it took
into account the particularities of each one. This code can then be used
as the basis for all interfaces created using the <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> principle, and can be
expanded as we implement them. Additional resources on specific commands
I have used can be found in Appendix <a href="#sec:supplementary"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:supplementary">8</a>.</p>
<p>In this section, I break down the steps from the first switch-on to
loading the webpage and sending the sensor data, documenting the
obstacles I encountered depending on the device.</p>

<figcaption>List of the 14 smartphones selected with their year of release and their ability to be used as a server unit, a hotspot unit and a client unit. Devices that could not be turned on or unlocked are marked in pink.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first step for each smartphone is to turn it on and unlock it.
Some of the phones in my batch had not been switched on for a long time,
or had been considered “bricked” by their users. So for each phone, I
began by charging the battery, then tried to switch it on. Some did not
make it through this stage, and so I eliminated them from my batch as
they require a more advanced level of repair. Table <a href="#tab:step1"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:step1">[tab:step1]</a>
summarises which of the 14 smartphones could be turned on and unlocked,
5 smartphones were eliminated at this stage. For example, this was the
case with one of the two Samsung Galaxy S III <span
class="math inline">(<code>3</code>)</span>, the Huawei Y6 <span
class="math inline">(<code>11</code>)</span>, Moto E4 <span
class="math inline">(<code>8</code>)</span> and the Oppo Find X2 <span
class="math inline">(<code>14</code>)</span>. <span
class="math inline">(<code>3</code>)</span>, <span
class="math inline">(<code>8</code>)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(<code>11</code>)</span> had no reaction when the
power button was pressed, requiring a diagnosis beyond my scope. On the
other hand, <span class="math inline">(<code>14</code>)</span> vibrated
when switched on without displaying anything, suggesting a dead screen.
To check whether the devices are detected as serial usb ports (and
therefore check whether they are alive), I connected the smartphones to
my computer to verify whether they were detected as a USB serial
interface. The Oppo <span class="math inline">(<code>14</code>)</span>
was indeed detected as an interface. An alternative rescue would
therefore be to try connecting it to an external display using the “HDMI
Alt Mode”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> protocol, but this was beyond my
scope. Interestingly, the Fairphone <span
class="math inline">(<code>12</code>)</span> did not pass this stage
either, because it was locked. After switching it on, I had to enter a
password that I did not have, and I did not know the person who had
given it to me. I naively tried to carry out a factory reset on the
phone, but I came up against the Factory Reset Protection protocol,
which requires signing in to the last Google account associated with the
device. There are strategies, but they are time consuming, require
scrolling many forums and “adventurous” operations, as I read on one of
them. Some of these strategies involve exploiting security breaches that
are patched over time, which means that the newer, or recently updated
the phone, the less easy it is to bypass the FRP. So it is important to
make sure that devices are reset to zero before disposing of them.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-server">Setting up a server</h2>
<p>The second step is to examine which smartphones are capable of acting
as a server, which involves running <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> in my case. To install and
run <span class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> uses the <span
class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span><a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
application, which is only available on Android. As a result, the two
iPhones <span class="math inline">(<code>1</code>)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(<code>5</code>)</span> in my selection will not be
able to be server units.</p>
<p>There are several ways to download <span
class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span>, the easiest of which is to
go to the Google Play Store<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and download the
application, but this is only available for devices with Android 11
(released in 2020) or later. The other disadvantage is that this
involves associating all devices with a Google account. For these
reasons, I chose to install the application without going through the
Google Play Store, but rather directly by downloading the
<code>.apk</code> file. This process requires a few additional steps:
installing <em>Android Debug Bridge</em> (<code>adb</code>)<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, and enabling USB debugging mode on
the device to be able to load applications on the phone. These steps are
widely documented on the web. Once this is done, it is possible to
easily access the smartphone’s information and install <code>apk</code>
files on it. The next step is to download the <code>apk</code> file, for
example from <span class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span>’s github<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, selecting the file corresponding
to the Android version and the device’s CPU ABI<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>.
Table <a href="#tab:server" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:server">[tab:server]</a> gives a summary of the
different versions and CPU ABI’s of the Android devices in my batch.</p>
<figure id="tab:server">
<img src="images/tab2.png" />
<figcaption>Summary of the Android versions, the ABI of each of the android Smartphones in the batch, the availability of Termux and, if applicable, the version of Node.js available.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once <span class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span> is installed
and running, it is possible to install <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span>. (The smartphone must be
connected to the internet first.) For devices running Android &lt;7, the
version of <span class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span> no longer
updates the package database, which sometimes forces the use of
discarded version packages<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. The installation of
<span class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> went well on the device
<span class="math inline">(<code>2</code>)</span> running Android 6. The
version of <span class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> available
in Long Term Support (LTS) is <code>12.13.0</code>. However, an error
occurred when using the <code>npm</code> command, which allows packages
to be installed in <span class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span>.
Unfortunately I did not have any other devices running Android 5 or 6 to
compare, but as the tablet used in the <em>Zombichord</em> prototype
runs Android 5, I know it is possible to use these OS versions. <span
class="math inline"><em>Termux</em></span> is available from Android 5,
which eliminates my device <span
class="math inline">(<code>4</code>)</span> running Android 2.</p>
<p>Once <span class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> was installed,
I used git to download my test environment. At this stage, the folder
only contains a <span class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span>
project and the necessary dependencies for <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>: <code>express</code> to
create <code>http</code> servers, and <code>websocket</code> to use the
real-time socket protocol for sending messages. The aim is to check that
all versions of <span class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> can
generate servers with these two components, and if there are any
particularities to take into account depending on the version of <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span>, to ensure that these are
added to my code. As a result, and after a few syntax corrections linked
to the different versions, both version <code>12.13.0</code> and the
current LTS version (<code>22.15.0</code>) of <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> can run the server.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-local-network">Setting up a local network</h2>
<p>For the interface built with <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> to be standalone, at least
one of the devices must be able to act as a hotspot to generate a local
network among all the devices. While most devices allow this connection
sharing option, some OSes require mobile data to activate this network
sharing. This is the case for all IOS devices, and some Android-based
interfaces like in my case here with device <span
class="math inline">(<code>6</code>)</span> which has a One UI 1.1
interface. Table <a href="#tab:step1" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:step1">[tab:step1]</a> summarises the devices in my
sample that can be used as hotspots.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-web-clients">Setting up web clients</h2>
<p>To test the possibilities of using each of the smartphones as a
client, I developed, as in the case of the server, a code example which
I put to the test on each of the devices and their browsers, and I
improved it according to the problems encountered. I managed to get a
touch interface working and to obtain IMU data from all the phones and
send it to the server via <code>websocket</code>. I detail below the
obstacles encountered and how I overcame them.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="javascript-es6">Javascript ES6</h3>
<p>To communicate with the server, clients use the javascript language.
In 2015, a major version of javascript (ES6) was released, making some
older browsers incompatible. This is the case, for example, with the
browsers of <span class="math inline">(<code>4</code>)</span>. All the
interfaces developed on <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> are compatible with the
older version of JavaScript (ES5).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="motion-sensors">Motion sensors</h3>
<p>Most smartphones have two inertia sensors: the accelerometer and the
gyroscope. In my batch, all the devices have an accelerometer, and all
except <span class="math inline">(<code>7</code>)</span> <span
class="math inline">(<code>9</code>)</span> <span
class="math inline">(<code>10</code>)</span> <span
class="math inline">(<code>13</code>)</span> a gyroscope. These two
sensors respectively provide motion and orientation data via the
<code>DeviceOrientationEvent</code> and <code>DeviceMotionEvent</code>
interfaces.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain sensor data from all the devices, taking into
account the following small details in my code.</p>
<p>– Safari on IOS 14.5 introduced a new security feature for access to
inertial sensors: <code>requestDevicePermission</code>.</p>
<p>– Access to sensor data requires a secure server (<code>https</code>)
on most recent browsers, which I have enabled as an option in my
code.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="secured-server-https">Secured server
(https)</h3>
<p>A secure server is set up by creating a key and a certificate. Each
certificate is linked to the server’s IP address. As secure servers are
necessary for the use of inertial sensor data, I have created a script
allowing certificates to be generated directly from a command line.</p>
<p>Very old versions of Android Browser before 4.4.4 are incompatible
with the <code>https</code> protocol. To avoid this problem on <span
class="math inline">(<code>4</code>)</span>, I installed a version of
Firefox (Firefox 31) that supports <code>https</code>. The
implementation of secure servers also has the effect of displaying alert
pages when the interface is loaded, but these can be bypassed, often by
clicking on a link such as “I trust this website”.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="secured-websockets-wss">Secured Websockets
(wss)</h3>
<p>When the server is set for https, the <code>websocket</code> protocol
must also be secured. This is taken into account in my code, but in the
case of IOS devices &lt; 13, it is necessary to install the certificates
to use the <code>wss</code> protocol. To do this, the certificate needs
to be downloaded, installed, then activated in the IOS settings :
<code>Settings &gt; General &gt; About &gt; Certificate Trust Settings</code></p>
<h2 id="outcome-1">Outcome</h2>
<p>By taking a heterogeneous batch of smartphones, varying in their OS,
release date and browser, I was able to explore in greater breadth the
possibilities offered by a web approach such as <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>. This methodical and
iterative work has also enabled me to develop a common code base that
can run on all these devices, and that supports most of their specific
features. This provides a base from which to create new applications and
which can be fed with other functionalities and APIs.</p>
<h1 id="integration-into-two-musicians-practices">Integration into two
musicians’ practices</h1>
<p>While I have investigated the potential of a web-based approach to
creating controllers from obsolete smartphones, from a technical point
of view, I am now trying to understand how this tool could be integrated
into real practices, using the example of music interfaces. During my
study, I had many exchanges with two friends, both professional
musicians with a background in electronic music composition and
performance using numerous controllers and synthesizers. We exchanged
ideas about their practices and habits in using tools to produce and
perform. Then we imagined how <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> could enable them to build
their instrument or their musical controller, and more generally how
they envision the directions this tool could take.</p>
<p>Despite their very different practices and styles, Jean Turner<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> and s8jfou<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
both have a strong focus on tools and machines, which they like to make
their own by exploring the possibilities of customisation. Both have a
particular affection for the restrictions that machines bring to their
work, and at the same time the freedom that computers bring to sound
design.</p>
<p>Jean Turner’s musical performances are somewhere between dance and
experimental music, often using samplers and sequencers that he
interfaces with his computer via <em>Ableton</em><a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
and MIDI<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. On stage, his gestures and
movements are at the heart of his performance. Jean Turner has built
instruments and controllers using “Axoloti core” <span class="citation"
data-cites="charles_using_nodate"></span> which he describes as a sort
of audio and MIDI Swiss army knife, very simplified for the user. It
allows him to do precise things according to his needs and to have
certain functions that do not exist in other controllers.</p>
<p>Questioning the tools and the visual composition on stage is
particularly at the heart of the work of s8jfou. s8jfou makes electronic
music essentially with his computer and builds his instruments with
MAX/MSP<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> with which he interacts on stage.
He has also built a few synthesizers<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> himself using
micro-controllers such as <em>Teensy</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="edstrom_arduino_2016"></span> and <em>Raspberry PI pico</em>
<span class="citation" data-cites="halfacree_get_2021"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="textitzombitron-as-a-performing-tool-for-jean-turner"><span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> as a performing tool for
Jean Turner</h2>
<figure id="fig:jeanturner">
<img src="images/jean.jpg" />
<figcaption>Jean Turner has created different mechanisms to design an
interactive interface for playing with smartphones connected to his
software via Open Sound Control.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When I presented my work on <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> to Jean Turner, he
immediately imagined how he could integrate motion sensors into his
scenic performance and composition. Using smartphones to perform opens
up new horizons for him. “<em>I did not want to play with a computer on
stage because I did not like the aesthetics. With <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>, it is logical because it
democratises computer music even more and there is a playability that
does not exist with other instruments.</em>” Jean Turner also mentions
the educational aspect that this can engender in his stage performance:
“<em>For the audience, turning knobs does not mean much, whereas seeing
the sound change with the tilt of an old smartphone is more
intuitive.</em>”</p>
<p>Jean Turner started building a whole range of articulated supports
using LEGO® Technic to use smartphones as controllers connected to his
Ableton software with Open Sound Control. As shown Figure <a
href="#fig:jeanturner" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:jeanturner">6</a>, he created several supports to
hold his two smartphones and then mounted these supports on different
mechanisms, allowing them to rotate on two or three axes. Some of these
mechanisms make use of motors to activate a continuous rotation of one
smartphone and lights activated by the weight of the smartphone when put
in certain supports. While he was making his LEGO®, he sent me a number
of videos, in which he describes his enthusiasm as he explores the
interactions, the effects he will be able to generate and the way he
will compose his live show. “<em>I can put one on top of the other, and
then my values are the same for both!</em>”. “<em>I just thought I can
even use it as percussions.</em>”</p>
<h2
id="zombee-a-collaborative-musical-instrument-for-s8jfou"><code>Zombee</code>,
a collaborative musical instrument for s8jfou</h2>
<figure id="fig:s8jfou">
<img src="images/s8jouf.png" />
<figcaption>s8jfou has begun designing <code>Zombee</code>, a
collaborative instrument optimised to run on devices with low processing
capacity. A and B show two of the four composition interfaces and C
shows the conductor interface.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>s8jfou immediately saw in <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> the possibility of
creating a collaborative composition environment, and was stimulated by
the idea of generating sound capable of being played by devices with
very limited computing power.</p>
<p>In 2022, <em>MAX</em> released <em>RNBO</em>, a library for exporting
<em>MAX</em> projects (patches) in portable code to compile them
directly for given platforms, in particular WebAssembly. They have also
released an <code>npm</code> package <a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
that allows this compiled code to be loaded directly via <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span>. From there, it was easy to
imagine how to combine s8jfou’s practice of <em>MAX</em> and <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>.</p>
<p>s8jfou has designed <code>Zombee</code>, which he began to implement
in <em>MAX</em>. <code>Zombee</code> is an instrument consisting of 4
playing interfaces and a master interface, enabling several people to
compose and play together. The 4 tactile interfaces (Figure <a
href="#fig:s8jfou" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:s8jfou">7</a> <code>(A)</code> and <code>(B)</code>)
differ simply by the sample bank, and can be percussive, bass, synth,
noise, etc. To this sound “search” interface, he added a sequencer to be
able to compose. Added to these 4 instruments, he created an interface
dedicated to the controlling the different parameters of the 4 instances
(Figure <a href="#fig:s8jfou" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:s8jfou">7</a> <code>(C)</code>), the volume, the
BPM, the different effects (Delay, Reverb,...). “<em>A bit like an
orchestra conductor</em>”. s8jfou envisaged <code>Zombee</code> by
thinking about the limits in terms of memory and computing capacity that
the device generating the sound might have. To achieve this, he uses the
principle of granular synthesis <span class="citation"
data-cites="roads_introduction_1988"></span>, involving the use of
samples of very short duration so that relatively light files can be
loaded. He has designed his instrument so as to connect all the effects
to a single output managed by the conductor, which also means that the
effects (which consume a lot of CPU resources) are applied only once. He
also identifies the advantage of versatility offered by this approach,
imagining how it could be both stand-alone and used with a more powerful
computer. “<em>Depending on the power of the device used, more or less
can be done in sound synthesis. The tool is therefore very powerful if
you want to use it, for example, with a recent computer but with old
phones to control it remotely, but is also capable of doing more modest
things when run from an old phone.</em>”</p>
<h2 id="outcome-2">Outcome</h2>
<p>These exchanges and the way in which s8jfou and Jean Turner envision
the integration of obsolete smartphones into their work is very
promising and opens up many avenues for reflection. The reuse of
obsolete smartphones made accessible thanks to <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> has clearly stimulated my
two friends, and largely motivates the continuation of this work, by
developing specific tools to make their two prototype projects possible.
I discuss the generative potential of these discussions and beginnings
of work as well as the implications for tools and future work in the
next section.</p>
<h1 id="discussion-and-future-work">Discussion and future work</h1>
<p>In this article, I explored how a web-based approach could enable the
reuse of a heterogeneous set of obsolete smartphones and tablets varying
in OS and release date. This work allowed me to explore how to create
new interactive systems by combining devices of different natures as
basic materials. This approach can be seen as an “augmentation” as
described by Remy et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="remy_addressing_2014"></span>, as this combination is an
augmentation of obsolete smartphones with other obsolete
smartphones.</p>
<p>During my experiments on 14 obsolete smartphones, I initiated the
development of a code base that can be used as the starting point for
various applications. In particular, I explored how this approach could
be used in the work of musicians through discussions with s8jfou and
Jean Turner. This study and exchanges open up some promising
perspectives on ways of pursuing the work toward a toolkit and combining
it with the various software tools used by musicians, other creative
practitioners and beyond.</p>
<p>The whole idea behind this work is to define the position of the
cursor between the design opportunities and the device’s capabilities.
In terms of design opportunities, this work is primarily focused on the
possibilities for interaction offered by the combination of several
obsolete smartphones or tablets. In the code base I have developed for
the purposes of this study, I have integrated tactile, motion and
orientation data by exploring the different constraints generated by the
different ages and operating systems of smartphones. For now, my
approach has been to start with the older ones and assess what they can
do, assuming that the newer ones can also do it. Therefore, the first
straightforward way of pursuing this work is to explore the other
interaction possibilities offered by smartphones. For example, with the
camera or microphone, which could easily be streamed using protocols
such as WebRTC. In my sample of 14 phones, many are also equipped with a
brightness sensor, a fingerprint reader, an NFC chip detector, and many
others which are all interaction opportunities with which to design new
systems. Access to the installation of recent browsers on older devices
will also make it possible to benefit from the latest APIs such as
SensorAPI<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>, USB<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
or even bluetooth<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>. The possibilities for interaction
can also be extended by the simple fact that, by definition, any object
capable of connecting to a network can be interfaced with <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>. It would be interesting
to connect this work with the one of Norbisrath et al. <span
class="citation" data-cites="norbisrath_empowering_2025"></span> on
repurposing smartphones into gateways for IoT. More generally, exploring
the limitations of a web approach based on <span
class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span> is another avenue of
research.</p>
<p>In this work, I covered the fact that the capability of devices
depends on their age and OS, and I explored these aspects in my study.
However, capabilities also depend on other factors, in particular their
general condition. Most of the smartphones I have used have been in
pretty good condition, apart from some broken screens and batteries at
the end of their life. It would therefore be important to continue this
work, both by continuing to explore interactive capabilities, but also
by confronting devices with possibly other limitations. Further work
could also look at ways in which end-users can identify and choose
combinations of obsolete devices based on their performance. And extend
it to other, more application-optimal techniques.</p>
<p>The other major part of the design opportunities is the different
applications that this tool base will enable. Here, there are two
different directions which are perfectly illustrated by the two distinct
approaches of Jean Turner and s8jfou. In one case, Jean Turner envisages
his use of <span class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> as a
controller connected to <em>Ableton</em>, while s8jfou designs
<code>Zombee</code> as a standalone. On the one hand, <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> must be capable of
interfacing with the software and, on the other, the application is
executed by the smartphone. These two approaches do not involve the same
things.</p>
<p>In the case of Jean Turner, this is very easy to envisage as it does
not require much extra work from the smartphones. <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> is based on
<code>websocket</code>, but it is also possible to communicate sensor
data from other protocols such as Open Sound Control (OSC),
<code>MQTT</code>, and others that are relatively easy to implement in
the tool with <span class="math inline"><em>Node.js</em></span>. OSC is
a relatively widespread protocol, not only for controlling music but
also other VJing or real-time graphic composition software such as
<em>Touch Designer</em> or <em>Resolume</em>. It would also be
interesting to explore how a controller made from discarded smartphones
would be considered by AV practitioners. It would also be simple to turn
it into a stream deck.</p>
<p>In the case of s8jfou however, the underlying challenge is to explore
the capabilities of smartphones and see how to optimise applications and
compose them specifically for computing performance. I was confronted
with latency problems in the case of the two prototypes
<em>Zombitronica</em> and <em>Zombichord</em>, using the Web Audio
library <em>Tone.js</em>. At that point, the only strategy explored was
to remove all the effects that consume resources. A very limiting
approach in terms of functionality and creative possibilities for
musicians.</p>
<p>This opens up avenues of exploration for future work on web
approaches to performance-constrained audio synthesis on obsolete
smartphones <span class="citation"
data-cites="tapparo_leveraging_2023"></span> and interactivity <span
class="citation" data-cites="matuszewski_web-based_2020"></span>. From a
web perspective in particular, one strategy to explore is the use of
<em>WebAssembly</em><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>, a format that allows most hardware
capabilities to be accessed from the web browser. It is on this
principle that <em>RNBO</em>, the portable extension of <em>MAX</em>, is
based. <em>MAX</em> is a popular tool among sound creators and it would
therefore be a good entry point for exploring <em>WebAssembly</em> on
obsolete smartphones. The idea of <code>Zombee</code> represents an
exciting direction to explore in terms of how a combination of more or
less powerful devices can generate rich music and allow musicians a wide
playing environment.</p>
<p>The advantage of collaborating with practitioners is that, as well as
enabling a new approach to be compared with real practices, there can be
an overlap of optimisation approaches. The latter can be thought out by
the tool implementation, but also by the creator themself, for example
here, the idea of using granular synthesis of s8jfou. The work initiated
with <code>Zombee</code> is also very promising in terms of the
collaborative aspect that s8jfou envisages for this prototype, and its
approach is very much in line with the work of Golvet et al.<span
class="citation" data-cites="golvet_designing_2024"></span> and
Matuszewski et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="matuszewski_interaction_2019 matuszewski_soundworks_2019 matuszewski_web-based_2020"></span>.
It would also be interesting to combine low-tech approaches to
instrument making with <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>, such as Nunes et al.’s
ingenious ideas featured in Sibilim <span class="citation"
data-cites="nunes_sibilim_2019"></span>. Sustainability seems to have a
place in NIME’s thinking <span class="citation"
data-cites="masu_o_2023"></span>, and there are undoubtedly many bridges
to be built with the work of this community, given their thinking and
political positions on technologies <span class="citation"
data-cites="jourdan_culture_2023"></span>. The case of music and art in
general is a good research environment for this work since the
communities are inclined to explore new approaches for creation. The
musical axis allows many aspects at the heart of the problems of this
work to be explored, namely interactivity, design and performance.</p>
<p>That said, this work could also have implications in other contexts,
especially because of the low cost of implementation made possible by
the reuse. For example, it could be used for low-cost installation in
the case of documentation tools in makerspaces and laboratories <span
class="citation" data-cites="rigaud_exploring_2022"></span>, it could
also enable rapid prototyping of interfaces and be used as inexpensive
teaching material. s8jfou and Jean Turner both mentioned to me that it
would be great to teach computer music in the workshop they or their
friends are giving.</p>
<p>My discussions with s8jfou and Jean Turner also suggest a generative
power of the reuse of smartphones in creativity. Firstly, from the point
of view of the aesthetics of using smartphones. Neither Jean Turner and
s8jfou did particularly envisage the smartphones being concealed in an
outfit, as had been explored in the case of <em>Zombitronica</em> and
<em>Zombichord</em>. On the contrary, Jean Turner explained to me how he
planned to make these phones an integral part of his live show.
“<em>It’s great, I will be able to take them and put them next to each
other, then put them back down again.</em>”. He also mentions the
benefit of a smartphone as an interactive interface known by the
audience, enabling them to understand what is happening on stage, as
opposed to the action of turning knobs. This relates to Mansoux
et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="mansoux_permacomputing_2023"></span>’s reflections on
retro-computing aesthetics, which tend to persist in permacomputing
approaches. Perhaps we could imagine an antero-computing aesthetic
embodied by the smartphone or other smartwatches in the next few years.
Another interesting generative aspect is that, although the approach is
by no means a new technology, the idea of building a new system with
obsolete smartphones seemed to stimulate my two friends. For example,
gyroscopes have been around for a long time, as have smartphones
connected to local networks, so <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span> is not inventing anything
that does not already exist. But in the case of Jean Turner and s8jfou,
it has generated a lot of new ideas. Perhaps the anticipation of a
simple, accessible tool opens up a whole range of new possibilities.</p>
<p>Although this paper is essentially the beginning of work towards a
toolbox to facilitate the reuse of obsolete smartphones, and my
discussions were limited to two of my musician friends, it already
identifies the opportunities that a collaborative approach between
researchers and designers can generate for the design of tools. This is
in line with my desire to build bridges between communities, and the
importance of designing tools to encourage the appropriation of
sustainable techniques <span class="citation"
data-cites="roedl_sustainable_2015 lu_unmaking_2024"></span>.</p>
<p>My aim is to push this study further by exploring the design of new
prototypes to explore more interaction opportunities and software and
hardware limitations in a research-creation process as a means of
feeding this toolbox. The projects we have initiated with s8jfou and
Jean Turner are an embodiment of this.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this article, I presented <span
class="math inline"><em>Zombitron</em></span>’s simple idea of making
interfaces with obsolete smartphones using a high-level, web-based
approach. Then, I’ve explored this approach in more depth, confronting
it with a range of obsolete smartphones varying in OS and software
version. This enabled me to start the work toward a promising toolkit to
favour appropriation of the reuse of these discarded devices. Through
exchanges with two musicians leading to two speculative prototypes of
musical controllers, we were able to explore how this toolkit could
possibly be relevant to their practice. This work gives rise to a number
of directions for research into the development of re-use techniques to
encourage appropriation by creative practitioners and beyond. Firstly,
it provides inspiration to pursue work on this toolkit and to continue
exploring the design opportunities offered by the combination of
obsolete smartphones and other obsolete devices. Secondly, it motivates
the collaborative approach with artists to determine how the use of
smartphones could not only enable them to adopt a more sober and less
costly approach to their use of tools, but also be integrated as a
central element of their performance. More generally, this work
represents a new step towards democratising the use of obsolete
smartphones, despite their complexity and heterogeneity.</p>

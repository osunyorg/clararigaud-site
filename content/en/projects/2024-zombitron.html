        <p>This project was initiated during the period I worked at the cooperative <a href="https://noesya.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">noesya <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, as part of the research axis <a href="https://sane.noesya.coop/fr/axis-4/#axe-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Interactive General Interest Devices <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>to design more sober interactive interfaces. Among the levers that allow this, the reuse of old electronic devices is an important axis to explore, and in particular the case of smartphones. Thus, the idea of common toolbox project to easily build new interfaces has emerged.</p>

        <p>Zombitron's principle is to allow everyone to easily build new control interfaces for music or scenography, with smartphones from any OS, simply equipped with a browser and without the need for an additional computer or router.</p><p>In practice, several smartphones or tablets communicate with each other via Wi-Fi. A node.js server runs on one of the smartphones via the Termux app, another (or the same) shares its connection to generate a local network between all smartphones, and the other smartphones load a web page, thus creating as many controllers.</p>

        <p>The Zombitron project is guided by the following principles:</p><ul> <li> <b>Re-use: </b>all the material used comes from re-use as far as possible.</li> <li> <b>Aesthetic:</b> It is not necessary to know that the device is designed from old electronic objects.</li> <li> <b>Solidity: </b> The device must be solid in order to be used by the public.</li> <li> <b>Simplicity:</b> The device shall be capable of being assembled, switched on and off easily. </li> <li> <b>Interoperability: </b> Zombitrons must be able to be declined or adapted on as many obsolete devices as possible.</li> </ul>

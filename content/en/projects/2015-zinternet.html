    Zinternet
  summary: >-
    <p>The Zinternet project is an interactive drawing experience imagined as part of the development of the <a href="https://www.zinefest.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zinefest website <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> in 2015.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>For my studies, I had to make a website, and I don't like things that do nothing but get a grade. I therefore proposed  Disparate , which organizes this micro-edition festival, to make the website of the festival. The idea behind Zinternet is a white page on which all visitors to the site can draw. The drawings produced by visitors are also posted on the  Tumblr  of the project. These drawings are then published as a fanzine available at a free price supporting the Zinefest festival. Today, it continues to accompany the Zinefest festival year after year, welcoming drawings for each new edition. <br>The second edition is archived at the Fanzinothèque de Poitier</p>  <p>Random Pixel Order </p>

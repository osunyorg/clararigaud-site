        <p>Diyauto Orchestra is an interactive and immersive installation that celebrates the shrouding and doing it yourself in an infinitely textured universe. This creation was initiated by the visual artist <a href="https://simonlazarus84.com/" target="_blank">Simon Lazarus<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> in collaboration with the musician <a href="https://www.s8jfou.com/" target="_blank">S8jfou<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>, and the developer and researcher Clara Rigaud.</p><p>Between kinetic art, contemporary graffiti and biomaterials, the installation consists of a generative audio/video fresco and an archipelago of mini sculptures-instruments. The public is invited to interact with the image and sound through these objects, giving them life and engaging them with living programs. The visual and sound environment is generated as the instruments are explored. Diyauto Orchestra creates a playful relationship with the object: to what gesture will the sculptures respond and what event will its image produce?</p>

    <p>  <br>Over the past ten years, I have been involved in various types of projects alongside my university studies. I co-created the  Random Pixel Order  collective with which we worked on projects at the intersection of digital art, DIY and micro-edition, exploring and promoting virtual and physical creative techniques. Then, I did a thesis in Human Computer Interaction during which I designed different prototypes to promote knowledge sharing in fabrication workshops. Today, I continue to work on projects involving technologies, humans and non-humans. I am committed to giving people the freedom to empower themselves in the face of technology, and to exploring how and if technology can be part of the future of our world. I am open to all types of projects according to my ethics :)</p>  <p> My journey  <br>Developper & Researcher <br>Employee at noesya 2024, Paris From February to October, I worked for the  noesya cooperative . My work consisted of: - opening a  new research axis  around sober interactive devices. - training myself and developing components and sites with the  Osuny digital commons. It was in this context that the  Zombitron  project was initiated, leading to  two prototypes  made by  Marion Jolas  (the intern I supervised) and myself at the  Villette Makerz workshop .</p>  <p>PhD <br>Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 2019 &gt; 2023, ISIR, Sorbonne University From 2019 to 2023, I realized a  PhD thesis  in the field of Human-Computer Interaction at the  ISIR laboratory  ( HCI group ) of Sorbonne University in Paris. Under the direction of  Yvonne Jansen  and  Gilles Bailly , I have worked on the design of tools to support knowledge sharing related to fabricationn activities within makespaces, fablabs, workshops, and more generally the DIY community. My thesis is part of the project  AfFABle  and I worked in close relationship with the  Fablab de Sorbonne University  where I organized weekly workshops around various machines, prototyping, programming and craft activities. I defended my thesis on June 15, 2023, and you can read the manuscript  here .</p>  <p>Workshop <br>Augmented Reality and Mobile Applications 2019 &gt; 2022, Sorbonne University Teaching to master students at the Sorbonne.</p>  <p>Workshop <br>Fabrication, design, 3D printing, laser cutting, Arduino |  Students and SU Crew 2021 &gt; 2022, Fablab Sorbonne University Organization of weekly workshops/trainings around Fablab activities.

I was working on the project  COVR  , a large virtual reality arena consisting of a two-axis robotic column designed to provide a  Haptic feedback  in virtual reality. During this work, I contributed to the realization of the virtual testing environments of the prototype, to the construction of a calibration tool in Unity to align the coordinates of the VR helmet with the coordinates of the motorized column, and to the visualization of the user's hand in the virtual environment in real time.</p>  <p>Internship <br>Vision-based robotic navigation 2018, Lip6 Paris At the end of my first year of Master's, I completed an internship at  Lip6 laboratory  under the direction of  Cédric Herpson . The aim was to achieve a  robotic navigation  based solely on visual information and known environmental artifacts. For this, we designed an algorithm capable of building a 3D representation of the walls of the environment in real time, when exploring a room by the robot. The approach was to use  OpenCV  to detect  Key features  in the flow of acquired images, combined with  object detection  as a means of acquiring information on the distance of the walls of the room.</p>  <p>Master's degree <br>Computer Science & Technology Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Interactions and Decision-making ( AI2D ) 2017 &gt; 2019, Sorbonne University I went to Paris to pursue my master's degree in  multi-agent systems . During this period, I wanted to specialize in subjects related to  human-computer interaction  and 3D environments. In parallel, I experienced a lot with the  3D computer graphics  and video games, with  Unity ,  Blender  and  shaders .</p>  <p>Creator <br>Random Pixel Order 2015 &gt; 2019, Bordeaux / Paris I co-created the collective Random Pixel Order, a collective at the intersection between digital art and micro-edition, in which I conducted various actions ( See more here ).</p>  <p>Internship <br>Developping a library for Tangible Spherical Display 2016, Inria Bordeaux For two months, I worked with the  MANAO  team and the  POTIOC  team in the  INRIA  Bordeaux laboratory, under the direction of  Patrick Reuter  and  Anke Brock . I was in charge of designing a JS library for web developers to help them program applications on a spherical touch screen as they would with a traditional 2D web page. This work consisted of:  1) translating tactile inputs detected on the spherical screen via  TUIO  into classic JS-like events, including  parametric  transformations from  azimuthal  to  cylindrical  projections coordinates, and 2) applying the inverse visual transformation to  DOM  elements created in 2D, on the spherical screen. My contribution was part of “ Code The Globe ”, published at the PerDIS conference in 2017.</p>  <p>Bachelor <br>Mathematics and Computer Science applied in the Human and Social Sciences - cognitive sciences 2014 &gt; 2017, Grenoble / Bordeaux</p>  <p>Tutor <br>Python Tutoring 2015 &gt; 2016, University of Bordeaux</p>  <p>Bachelor of Technology <br>Multimedia and Internet occupations 2012 &gt; 2014, Institut Universitaire et Technologique Bordeaux Montaigne</p>  <p>Baccalauréat of Technology <br>Electrotechnical studies 2009 &gt; 2012, Lycée Galilée, Vienne</p>

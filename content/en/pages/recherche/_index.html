summary: >-
  <p>My research focuses on the design of interactive interfaces, with methodologies from HCI, interaction design and sustainability in design. </p><p>During my thesis I worked on knowledge sharing issues in the field of fabrication and workshops. <br>This has led me to become more interested in the sharing communities (DIWO), hacking, re-employment and open-source in general.</p><p>Since then, I have been studying how interactive devices can be designed in a more sober way, both from a hardware and software perspective.<br>In particular, I initiated the project <a href="https://www.zombitron.org/">Zombitron</a> which explores the re-use of obsolete smartphones, through different types of control interfaces, for music and scenography.</p>
